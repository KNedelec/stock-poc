This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It simulates a chart live rendering stock values. Stock values are refreshed
every second. You can edit/pause/play the rendering.

It is just a POC so many things are missing like navigating forward and backward
in the chart, error management, testing, and more...

### `node stock-service.js`

Starts the web service that provides the stock data
@see [node-stock-server](https://github.com/o2t/tutorial-node-stock-server)

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
